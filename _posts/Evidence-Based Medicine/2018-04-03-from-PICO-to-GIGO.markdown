Jefferson & Jørgensen recently wrote an interesting editorial in <i>BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine</i>, "[Redefining the ‘E’ in EBM](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2018-110918)," discussing the nature of evidence and the messy search for it in the current research environment. A couple quotes are worth pulling out:
  <br>
<blockquote>“By the law of Garbage In Garbage Out, whatever we produce in our reviews will be systematically assembled and synthesised garbage with a nice Cochrane logo on it.”</blockquote>

Reading this amusing line reminded me of an even more amusing exchange from the <i>Friends</i> episode, “The One with the Dirty Girl” (Season 4, Episode 6), where Ross gives the following short rant:

<blockquote>Ross: You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
  <br><br>
Joey: Yeah...
  <br><br>
Ross: Well, like that, only that instead of a chair it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived.</blockquote>

On a more serious note, Jefferson & Jørgensen end with a line worth remembering, inviting the reader to consider more deeply the issues they discuss:
  <br>
<blockquote>“Ethics and Evidence both begin with ‘E.’”</blockquote>
