Alexeyev and colleagues recently published a letter in the <i>British Journal of Dermatology</i> entitled, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjd.17085">
“Why we continue to the use the name <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i></a>,” in which they defended retaining this binomial 
nomenclature in opposition to the recent proposal to reclassify the <i>Propionibacterium</i> genus (<a href="http://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/ijsem/66/11/4422_ijsem001367.pdf?expires=1539012964&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=D1363D31920FBE5CE40E7856EAF9A0A8">Scholz & Kilian, 2016</a>).

The proposed reclassification would split the existing <i>Propionibacterium</i> species to genera 
<i>Acidopropionibacterium</i>, <i>Pseudopropionibacterium</i>, and <i>Cutibacterium</i>, with this last category containing 
the (in)famous <i>P. acnes</i> firmly implicated in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris.

Alexeyev et al. note that <i>P. acnes</i> was previously classified within the genus <i>Corynebacterium</i> (and thus often 
denoted <i>C. acnes</i>), and consider the choice of new genus name “unnecessary.” I take their point to be the fact that 
the proposed <i>Cutibacterium</i> genus could have been simply left as <i>Propionibacterium</i> without producing ambiguity 
with the other two proposed genera. This seems like a fair criticism, at least if we consider the added value of association 
with the skin (in the “cuti-“ prefix) a negligible advantage for the proposed renaming. However, the authors further imply 
that adopting the proposed change might produce “confusion with the earlier nomenclature,” presumably where <i>C. acnes</i> 
conflates <i>Corynebacterium acnes</i> and <i>Cutibacterium acnes</i>. Such overlap in nomenclature does not strike me as a 
meaningful risk for confusion; in either case <i>C. acnes</i> refers to the same bacterial species, and the authors’ letter 
implies that only very senior professionals will be familiar with the antiquated nomenclature anyway.

The authors’ remaining justification is that it would require “large changes” to medical infrastructure and “even larger 
changes” to pharmaceutical and cosmetic infrastructure to incorporate the name change consistently. For the sake of argument 
I will grant the authors that the first set of “large changes” may be prohibitive as they suggest. What is unclear to me is 
why the burden upon the commercial sector is of concern to the medical profession. <i>If</i> a change in nomenclature is 
scientifically and/or clinically justified, I do not take as a given that the interests of the commercial sector should be 
considered. I can conceive of good reasons why clarity in marketing and product labeling is desirable for physician and 
patient navigation of products, but the onus upon producers to maintain such clarity is their concern; it does not, in my 
opinion, merit consideration in the choice of nomenclature.

Overall I think the authors’ reasoning for preserving <i>P. acnes</i> may be sufficient, but I don’t find their argumentative 
approach particularly persuasive.
