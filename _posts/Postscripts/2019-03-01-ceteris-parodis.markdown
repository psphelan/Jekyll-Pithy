Andrew Gelman has an item in his [handy statistical lexicon](https://andrewgelman.com/2009/05/24/handy_statistic/) that he calls “[The ‘All Else Equal’ Fallacy](https://andrewgelman.com/2008/03/20/the_all_else_eq_1/),” summarized as:
<br>
<blockquote>Assuming that everything else is held constant, even when it’s not gonna be.</blockquote>
<br>
Since that idea that “all else <i>is</i> (or would be) equal” is often represented by the Latin <i>ceteris paribus</i>, and the point of Gelman’s fallacy is that (in cases where it applies) the assumption is simply ridiculous (parodic), perhaps we can humorously term the fallacy (in abused pseudo-Latin) “<i>ceteris parodis</i>.”
