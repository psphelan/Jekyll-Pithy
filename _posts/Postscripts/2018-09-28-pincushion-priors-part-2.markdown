It seems to me that a natural extension of the [pincushion prior concept](http://www.psphelan.com/postscripts/2018/09/26/pincushion-priors.html)
is to use the head of the pin to represent the probability mass attributed to the spike. When comparing to spike-and-slab 
models attributing different masses to the spikes(regardless of the respective slab models), the size of the pinhead can 
be illustrated such that is proportional to the respective probability mass.
<br><br>
Thus, for two spike-and-slab models <img src="http://mathurl.com/y7oqxxrn.png"> and <img src="http://mathurl.com/ybn6b6c6.png">
given as

<br>
the areas (<i>A</i>) of the pinheads for the illustrations of <img src="http://mathurl.com/y7oqxxrn.png"> and 
<img src="http://mathurl.com/ybn6b6c6.png"> should be illustrated such that:

<br>
An example is shown below for <img src="http://mathurl.com/y84vqcus.png"> with the spike probability masses unspecified. Note 
that the <i>y</i>-axis scales for probability density will differ when the spike masses differ, so the labels are omitted here.
