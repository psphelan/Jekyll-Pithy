Earlier this year Marquardsen and colleagues published a sobering study in the <i>Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine</i> 
entitled “[Redactions in protocols for drug trials: 
what industry sponsors concealed](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0141076817750554),” in which the authors requested a number of clinical trial protocols (and any related 
documents) and surveyed the materials received for censorship. They note at the outset that commercial entities are 
well-known to be uncomfortable with releasing such materials, often claiming that “they contain commercially sensitive 
information, trade secrets or intellectual property.”
<br><br>
I won’t summarize the entire paper, but needless to say the results constitute a piercing indictment of the industry-sponsored 
medical research complex. Here are a few highlights:
<br><br>
<li>It took <b><i>three years</i></b> for the authors to receive the full set of 78 trial protocols requested, and 
“several companies refused to provide their protocol and involved their lawyers.”</li>
<li>In some cases the redaction was hilariously sloppy, as the authors summarize: “In some protocols, we could reveal 
what was hidden by copying the blackened out text and pasting it into a Word document.”</li>
<li>Fully <i>half</i> (17) of the 34 protocols for commercially sponsored trials featured some redaction, as opposed to 
only two of 36 non-commercially sponsored trials, and three of the unredacted commercially sponsored trial protocols were 
missing related documents.</li>
<li>Across 22 assessment variables (ranging from primary outcome specification to randomization procedure) examined for 
the (17) redacted protocols, redaction pattern was highly variable and heterogeneous, with redaction identifiable in at 
least one case for almost every variable.</li>
<br><br>
The study abstract provides disheartening summaries:
<br>
<blockquote>“The redactions were most widespread in those sections of the protocol where there is empirical evidence of 
substantial problems with the trustworthiness of published drug trials…”</blockquote>
<br>
The message to take from this study is related to that emphasized by Jefferson &amp; Jørgensen, “In the last decade, evidence 
has accumulated, across a spectrum of different interventions, that journal publications cannot be trusted.” Apparently, 
neither can profit-driven funders be trusted to provide the means for investigators to evaluate the trustworthiness of the 
publications. It seems the claim to “trade secrets” provides an opaque “paper curtain” behind which corporations can conceal 
whatever they wish, and cutting through requires considerable investigatory effort to attempt to appraise the methodology 
underlying published research.
<br><br>
In a letter commenting on this study, [Will &amp; Noble (2018)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0141076818783303) observe that, 
<br>
<blockquote>“Arguably, the incomplete records provided in the modern, economically practical, model of science publication 
cannot sustain trust of science in the community…”</blockquote>
<br>
Indeed, and nor should they.
