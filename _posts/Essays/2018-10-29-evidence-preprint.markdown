I have recently posted my first ever preprint, an essentially finished draft of my essay, “[An Introductory Concept of Evidence for Medicine](https://osf.io/rz8pe/),” to the Open Science Framework’s native preprint server ([OSF Preprints](https://osf.io/preprints/)). 
<br><br>
I was surprised it took me as long as it did to find OSF Preprints as a hosting option, which I suppose is simply because I didn’t explore the [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/) (COS) and [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) (OSF) for myself at first. The OSF Preprints server isn’t listed explicitly on the [Wikipedia Preprint page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint), even though a number of OSF-supported dedicated servers are (e.g. AgriXiv, PaleorXiv, PsyArXiv), but it functions as a broad host for works in any field, with a wide variety of content field classifiers and custom tags available. As it is a free service of the non-profit Center for Open Science, it also conforms to requirements from some journals that preprints be hosted on non-profit servers. Being backed by the COS also confers the benefit that the OSF Preprints service has support guaranteed for the foreseeable future, and field-specific OSF-supported servers (such a PsyArXiv) have already experienced strong uptake, so I feel very comfortable using it for preprint hosting despite its youth and low profile. 
<br><br>
For whatever it’s worth, the under-development medical preprint server [MedArXiv](http://yoda.yale.edu/medrxiv) will also (reportedly) be supported by the OSF, once it goes live.

Edit (11/23/2018): It appears MedRXiv (however it will be spelled) will be hosted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, rather than the OSF.
