I recently came across a remarkable case report in <i>The American Journal of Medicine</i> concerning a bodybuilder with hypervitaminosis D complicated by hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury, for which the intoxication was attributed to use of a vitamin D-containing dietary protein supplement. (<a href=“http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(17)31029-X/fulltext”>Van et al. 2018</a>) Finding the authors’ discussion intriguing, I offered some thoughts on the matter as a Letter to the Editor. As the Journal declined to publish my commentary, I offer it openly here.
