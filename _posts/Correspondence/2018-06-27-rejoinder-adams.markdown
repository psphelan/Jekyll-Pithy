I recently published a correspondence item assessing Adams and O’Reilly’s original article in the <i>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</i>, which they titled “A likelihood-based approach to P-value interpretation provided a novel, plausible, and clinically useful research study metric.” Adams responded to my critique, but I found that his rebuttals deserved to be addressed and my original criticisms clarified. I have provided the current rejoinder to do so.
